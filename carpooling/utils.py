def haversine_distance(lat1, long1, lat2, long2):
    """
    Calculates the Haversine distance between two points
    on the earth's surface.
    
    The Haversine distance is the great-circle distance between 
    two points on a sphere. It is defined as the shortest
    distance between two points on a sphere that is calculated along 
    the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight
    line through the sphere's interior). The Haversine distance formula 
    is used to calculate the distance between two
    points on the earth's surface given their latitude and longitude coordinates.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    lat1 : float
        Latitude of the first point in degrees.
    long1 : float
        Longitude of the first point in degrees.
    lat2 : float
        Latitude of the second point in degrees.
    long2 : float
        Longitude of the second point in degrees.
        
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The Haversine distance between the two points in kilometers.

    This function calculates the match rate between two routes.
    The match rate is defined as the number of points in the shorter

    in the longer route. The haversine distance is used to calculate the
    distance between two points.
    
    Parameters:
    route1 (list of tuples): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the
    			     latitude and longitude of a point in the first route.
    route2 (list of tuples): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the latitude
    			     and longitude of a point in the second route.
    threshold (float): The maximum distance (in kilometers) that two points can be
    		       apart to be considered a match. The default value is 0.05 km.
    		       Ideally, the threshold should be selected so that it's less than
    		       the avg haversine distance between successive points in a route and big
    		       enough to account for slight variations in the point coordinates(errors)
