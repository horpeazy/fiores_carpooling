def haversine_distance(lat1, long1, lat2, long2):
    """
    Calculates the Haversine distance between two points
    on the earth's surface.
    
    The Haversine distance is the great-circle distance between 
    two points on a sphere. It is defined as the shortest
    distance between two points on a sphere that is calculated along 
    the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight
    line through the sphere's interior). The Haversine distance formula 
    is used to calculate the distance between two
    points on the earth's surface given their latitude and longitude coordinates.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    lat1 : float
        Latitude of the first point in degrees.
    long1 : float
        Longitude of the first point in degrees.
    lat2 : float
        Latitude of the second point in degrees.
    long2 : float
        Longitude of the second point in degrees.
        
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The Haversine distance between the two points in kilometers.
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> haversine_distance(37.7749, -122.4194, 40.7128, -74.0060)

def match_routes(route1, route2, threshold=0.05):
    """
    This function calculates the match rate between two routes.
    The match rate is defined as the number of points in the shorter
    route that are within a  certain distance threshold from the points
    in the longer route. The haversine distance is used to calculate the
    distance between two points.
    
    Parameters:
    route1 (list of tuples): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the
    			     latitude and longitude of a point in the first route.
    route2 (list of tuples): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the latitude
    			     and longitude of a point in the second route.
    threshold (float): The maximum distance (in kilometers) that two points can be
    		       apart to be considered a match. The default value is 0.05 km.
    		       Ideally, the threshold should be selected so that it's less than
    		       the avg haversine distance between successive points in a route and big
    		       enough to account for slight variations in the point coordinates(errors)
    
    Returns:
    float: The match rate between the two routes, expressed as a decimal value between 0 and 1.
    
    Example:
